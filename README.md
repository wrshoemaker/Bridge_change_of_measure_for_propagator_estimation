# Bridge Change of Measure for Propagator Estimation

This repository contains research code and numerical experiments for propagator (transition density) estimation of stochastic processes using change-of-measure techniques and bridge constructions. The focus is on comparing "gamma models" i.e., 1d SDEs that share the same gamma stationary distribution
$$X_t$$
